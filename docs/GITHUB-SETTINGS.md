## Repository Features

| Feature | Setting | Rationale |

| Sponsorship | ENABLE | Linked to `.github/FUNDING.yml` |

## Branch Protection Rules

Apply to `main` branch:

| Rule | Setting | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Require pull request reviews | ENABLE, 1 reviewer minimum | Credibility signal for open-source projects; prevents accidental direct pushes |
| Require status checks to pass | ENABLE, require `validate` workflow | Ensures CI passes before merge; builds contributor trust |
| Require branches to be up to date | ENABLE | Prevents merge conflicts from stale branches |
| Include administrators | OPTIONAL | Recommended ON for consistency, but maintainer may want override ability |

> **Why:** Branch protection is a credibility signal for open-source projects. Contributors and evaluators check for these as indicators of project maturity.
